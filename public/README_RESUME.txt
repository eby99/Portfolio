IMPORTANT: Resume Setup

To enable the "Download Resume" button on your portfolio:

1. Copy your resume PDF file (Eby_Resume.pdf) to this folder
2. Rename it to "resume.pdf"

Final path should be: E:\Portfolio\portfolio-eby\public\resume.pdf

The download button in the Hero section will then work correctly.

If the file is not added, the button will still appear but won't download anything.
